This repository showcases a common JavaScript error related to loose comparison (==) with null and NaN.  The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic code, where loose comparison can lead to unexpected results due to type coercion. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using strict equality (===) and explicit checks for null and NaN, ensuring robust handling of edge cases.
